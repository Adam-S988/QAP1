Rate the difficulty:
Overall, I would rate the difficulty about 3/10 - with 1 being super easy, and 10 being super difficult. 
I have certainly gained some insight for future projects. Some specific features I would probably still struggle with, but many tasks wouyld be a little easier now that I do have some practice in.
